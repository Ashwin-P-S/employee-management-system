    <h1>Andhra Pradesh</h1>
    <p>
        Andhra Pradesh is a state in the
        south-eastern coastal region of India.[15] It is the seventh-largest state by area covering an area of 162,975
        km2 (62,925 sq mi)[5] and tenth-most populous state with 49,386,799 inhabitants.[16][17] It is bordered by
        Telangana to the north-west, Chhattisgarh to the north, Odisha to the north-east, Tamil Nadu to the south,
        Karnataka to the west and the Bay of Bengal to the east.[18] It has the second longest coastline in India after
        Gujarat, of about 974 km (605 mi).[19] Andhra State was the first state to be formed on a linguistic basis in
        India on 1 October 1953.[20] On 1 November 1956, Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking areas (ten
        districts) of the Hyderabad State to form United Andhra Pradesh. In 2014 these merged areas of Hyderabad State
        were bifurcated from United Andhra Pradesh to form the new state Telangana. The present form of Andhra is
        similar to Andhra state, but some mandalas like Bhadrachalam are still included in Telangana. Amaravati serves
        as the capital of present Andhra with the largest city being Visakhapatnam.[21]

        Andhra Pradesh was once a major Buddhist pilgrimage site in the country and a Buddhist learning center which can
        be seen in many sites in the state in the form of monastery ruins, chaityas and stupas.[22][23] It is also known
        for being the land of Koh-i-Noor and other globally known diamonds from Kollur Mine.[24] It is also a major
        producer of rice known as the "Rice bowl of India".[25] Its official language is Telugu; one of the classical
        languages of India, the fourth most spoken language in India and the 13th-most spoken language in the
        world.[26][27] Andhra Pradesh's second official language is Urdu.
