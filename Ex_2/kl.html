    <h1>Kerala</h1>
    <p>
        Kerala is a state on the Malabar Coast of
        India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by
        combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and
        Thiruvithamkoor. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area.
        It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep
        Sea to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state
        by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most
        widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.
