    <h1>Tamil Nadu</h1>
    <p>
        Tamil Nadu is a state in southern stretch of
        India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the
        Tamil people, whose Tamil language—one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world—is widely
        spoken in the state and serves as its official language. The capital and largest city is Chennai.

    <h2>Prehistory</h2>
    <p>
        Archaeological evidence points to this area being one of the longest continuous habitations in the Indian
        peninsula.[13] In Attirampakkam near Chennai, archaeologists from the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education
        excavated ancient stone tools which suggest that a hominid population existed in the Tamil Nadu region somewhere
        around 1,000 years before homo sapiens arrived from Africa. A Neolithic stone celt (a hand-held axe)
        with the Indus script on it was discovered at Sembian-Kandiyur near Mayiladuthurai in Tamil Nadu. According to
        epigraphist Iravatham Mahadevan, this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in
        Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the Harappan language, and therefore
        that the "Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a Harappan language". The date of the celt was estimated
        at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. In Adichanallur, 24 km (15 mi) from Tirunelveli, archaeologists
        from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) unearthed 169 clay urns containing human skulls, skeletons, bones,
        husks, grains of rice, charred rice, and celts of the Neolithic period, 3,800 years ago. The ASI
        archaeologists have proposed that the script used at that site, Tamil Brahmi, is "very rudimentary" and date it
        somewhere between the 5th century BCE and 3rd century BCE. About 60 per cent of the total epigraphical
        inscriptions found by the ASI in India are from Tamil Nadu, and most of these are in the Tamil
        language. In Keezhadi near Madurai, excavations have revealed a large urban
        settlement dating to the 6th century BCE, during the time of urbanisation in the Gangetic plain. During this
        dig, some potsherds were uncovered with a script similar to Indus script, leading some to conclude it was a
        transition between the Indus Valley script and Tamil Brahmi script used in the Sangam period
